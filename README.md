Welcome to my front-end portfolio This project showcases some of the work I've done while learning and building with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. It's a collection of responsive layouts, simple animations, and interactive UI elements I've created to practice and improve my skills.

Iâ€™ve used Tailwind CSS to style everything from buttons to full-page layouts, focusing on clean design and mobile-friendly responsiveness.
